# WASTINNOVA
## MANAGE YOUR WASTE EFFECTIVELY

## Inspiration ðŸ’¡
 The proper management of waste products protects the environment from the hazardous impacts of the waste's component elements. Therefore, we chose the project name WASTINNOVA.
## What it does ðŸ¤–
- It will assist us in tracking the van that will take the waste from the specific spot, in addition to that we can also get to know about the details of van likeÂ van number, estimated arrival time, and closest land mark.
- It will offer us a range of disposal sizes from whereÂ we canÂ Â select the size of disposalÂ based on the amount of waste collected.
- It will notify us of the amount we have contributed in relation to location contribution.
- It offers a feature where users can enter their contact details so that companies who collect waste in large quantities for reuse can get in touch with them.
- The consumers can also choose a market place where they can purchase the best out ofÂ Â waste products.


## How we are building it ðŸ˜Œ

- In order to make the user interface (UI) simple to use and aesthetically pleasing, we used figma.
- Firebase is deployed as the backend for our created application's frontend, which allows it to store and serve many responses and requests at once.
- Git has been used for version control.
- Java serves as the basis language while Flutter is used for development.

## What's next for WastInnova ðŸ“ˆ
- On the data, we'll apply the machine learning principle. We will learn about the places where we are receiving the most wasteÂ 
- Knowing the areas where the most of the garbage is generated, we will endeavour to deploy additional vans there and spread the awarnessÂ about not leaving trash lying around.

## Business Model ðŸ’µ
- We will sell the dataâ€”which does not include any personally identifiable information about usersâ€”to businesses that recycle waste so they can get the most value out of it.
- Additionally, we'll work to create an e-commerce website where we can collaborate with businesses to let them to sell their best leftover products on our website.
